I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Convergence Security Engineering](https://www.sungshin.ac.kr/cse) at Sungshin Women's University. 
Before joining Sungshin Women's University, I was a research staff member at [Samsung SDS](https://www.samsungsds.com/us/index.html) from 2020 to 2024.
I received Ph.D degree in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)
My research interests includes privacy enhancing technologies (PET) for secure comptuation, especially homomorphic encryption or multi-party computation, and concrete security of lattice-based cryptographic hard problems.
